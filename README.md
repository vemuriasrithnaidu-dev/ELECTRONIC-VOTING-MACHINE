📌 Project Overview

The Electronic Voting System is a console-based application developed in C language that simulates a simple and secure voting process.
It allows eligible voters to cast their votes, prevents duplicate voting, counts votes accurately, and displays results only after admin authentication.

This project is mainly designed for academic learning, demonstrating concepts such as arrays, loops, conditional statements, input validation, time control, and basic security.
